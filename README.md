# EloCusTrans
Repository for Elona+ Custom english translation

I will attempt to translate all of the externalized text offered by E+ Custom (up to date using Bloodyshade's unofficial port to 1.65).

You are more than welcome to submit your own translation work and adjustments (I am more than happy to be corrected, as my Japanese isn't the greatest and I make mistakes).

If you are interested in such, please contact me (email: websnake.projectuber [at] gmailã€‚com)
